create a whole new nextjs webapp for admin panel
Project: WeDesignz Admin Panel — Next.js + Tailwind 

Create a Next.js + Tailwind admin frontend according to these requirements:
1) Tech stack & setup
   - Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Query (or SWR) for data fetching,
     Zustand (or Redux Toolkit) for global state (auth + notifications), Recharts for charts,
     Heroicons + Lucide for icons, Headless UI for accessible modals/dropdowns.
   - Provide package.json, tsconfig, tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js, .replit with start command.
   - Scripts: "dev", "build", "start", "lint", "format".
   - Provide a README with run + Replit secret instructions.

2) Style & Design system
   - Elegant, modern admin aesthetic: glassy cards, soft shadows, rounded 2xl, roomy spacing.
   - Palette (example — use CSS variables):
     --primary: #6C5CE7 (indigo purple)
     --accent:  #00BFA6 (teal accent)
     --muted:   #6B7280
     --bg:      #0F172A (dark) and gradient variants for header cards
     --card-bg: rgba(255,255,255,0.03)
   - Typography: Inter (system fallback), headings large & bold, subtle caps for metadata.
   - Light mode as default, with toggle.
   - Make the color pallete in variables so in future we just update variables to change themes.
   - Smooth micro-interactions: hover lift, subtle transitions, framer-motion entry animations.

3) Layout & navigation
   - Left persistent sidebar (collapsible) with icons + labels. Top bar for search, notification bell, user menu, quick actions.
   - Sidebar sections / routes:
     /dashboard
     /designers
     /customers
     /designs
     /orders/custom
     /transactions
     /plans
     /reports
     /analytics
     /notifications
     /system/configs
     /activity-log (AdminActivityLog)
     /settings
   - Collapsible project quick-switcher and global filters at top of sidebar.

4) Auth & Roles UI (reflects your backend flow) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
   - Login page: email + password. After valid credentials show 2FA verification modal for TOTP input.
   - 2FA setup flow (for new admin accounts): show QR code and copyable secret; "I set up" verification step.
   - Role-aware client: store role (Super Admin / Moderator) in auth context; guard routes by role (client-side guards + UI gating).
   - Logout: show confirmation modal; call refresh-token invalidate endpoint and show animated toast.

5) Dashboard (hero + KPI cards)
   - Top KPIs: Total Revenue (today/month), Active Users, New Designers (7d), Pending Payouts.
   - Real-time alerts strip for new custom orders & critical failures.
   - Charts: Revenue time-series, Top Designers (bar), Design trends (line), Active users sparkline.
   - Quick actions: Approve pending designer, Create report, Broadcast notification.

6) Core pages & their key UI features
   - Designers list & detail
     - Table with columns (Name, Joined, Status, Razorpay ID, Lifetime Earnings, Pending Payout, Actions).
     - Filters (onboarding status, account status), search, pagination, sort.
     - Detail drawer: profile, documents (image preview + download), wallets & transactions timeline, payout request actions (approve/schedule), suspend/delete buttons (Super Admin only), audit timeline.
     - Approve/reject onboarding modal with reason, 3-boolean checklist UI (moderator checkboxes vs superadmin final approve) per your logic. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
   - Customers page
     - Table + filters (status, plan_status). Customer profile: purchases, downloads, wishlist, cart, pause subscription button.
   - Designs page
     - Grid + list toggle. Moderation workflow: preview modal with image viewer, approve/reject with remark, mark featured/trending with expiry selector.
   - Transactions & Orders page
     - Master list: filter by type, date range, status, user, razorpay id. Refund modal with eligibility checks and audit notes.
   - Custom Orders
     - Live queue UI (ws updates). Each order has 1-hour SLA timer, progress controls, file upload for deliverables, cancel & partial refund flows.
   - Subscription Plans
     - CRUD UI & live preview. Deactivate rather than delete.
   - Reports & Analytics
     - Date-range selector, prebuilt reports (daily/monthly/yearly), CSV/XLS export button (initiates export job, shows job status).
   - System Configs
     - Form controls for commission_rate, GST %, featured content, banners (drag reorder), maintenance mode toggle (Super Admin only).
   - Notifications
     - Live feed component (WebSocket), persisted list with filters, bulk resolve/mark read, compose group email modal.
   - AdminActivityLog (Audit)
     - Searchable, filterable activity timeline with IP, user, action, before/after values. Row expand to show JSON payload.

7) Realtime & Background UX
   - WebSocket client integrated to show:
     - Real-time notifications (new custom order, failed transactions, payout requests). Bell shows badge.
     - Live queue updates for custom orders.
   - Graceful fallback: polling when ws unavailable.

8) Components library (deliver as reusable components)
   - DataTable (server side pagination + column defs + multi-select rows)
   - FilterBar (multi-filter chips)
   - DateRangePicker
   - KpiCard (with sparkline)
   - DesignerCard / UserCard
   - PreviewModal (image + file viewer)
   - ConfirmationModal (action reason field)
   - Toasts / Toastr service
   - FileUploader with chunking + progress
   - NotificationBell + LiveFeedDropdown
   - PermissionWrapper component (renders children only if role permitted)

9) API integration patterns
   - Central API client: `/lib/api.ts` using fetch + React Query. Abstract endpoints:
     AUTH: POST /api/admin/login, POST /api/admin/2fa/verify, POST /api/admin/logout
     DESIGNERS: GET /api/admin/designers, GET /api/admin/designers/:id, POST /api/admin/designers/:id/approve, POST /api/admin/designers/:id/payout
     CUSTOM ORDERS: GET /api/admin/custom-orders, POST /api/admin/custom-orders/:id/status
     TRANSACTIONS: GET /api/admin/transactions, POST /api/admin/transactions/:id/refund
     REPORTS: POST /api/admin/reports/generate
     CONFIGS: GET/PUT /api/admin/configs
     NOTIFICATIONS: GET/POST /api/admin/notifications
   - All calls must send Authorization: Bearer <access_token>. Token refresh via refresh token endpoint implemented in API client.
   - Use optimistic updates for approve/reject actions; rollback on error.

10) Accessibility & Responsiveness
    - Accessible components (Headless UI), keyboard operable modals, ARIA labels.
    - Responsive breakpoints: full sidebar on desktop, collapsed or bottom nav on mobile.

11) Tests & quality
    - Add sample unit tests for 2 components (DataTable, KpiCard) using Jest + React Testing Library.
    - Add ESLint + Prettier config.

12) Dev ergonomics & Replit specifics
    - Provide .replit to run `npm run dev`.
    - Add `.env.example` listing the env vars:
      NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE, NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET (or JWT secrets), RAZORPAY_KEY_ID (frontend placeholder), SENTRY_DSN (optional).
    - Document how to set Replit secrets and required CORS settings.
    - Provide seeds/mock API adapter for local dev if backend is not available (mocks for designers, transactions, custom orders).

13) Deliverables
    - Full repository scaffold with pages, components, styles, and README.
    - Workflows: detailed README section describing how to integrate backend endpoints and replace mock with real API.
    - Aesthetic polish: animations, dark mode, sample data, and screenshot-ready dashboard.

14) Security & caution notes
    - Do not include private keys in code. Razorpay operations should only be triggered server-side; show a UI that calls admin payout endpoints, but do not implement payment logic in frontend.
    - Ensure Super Admin-only actions are gated in the UI and re-checked by backend.

15) Bonus polish (do if time allows)
    - Add CSV export UI for any table (streaming).
    - Add keyboard shortcuts (G to go to dashboard, / to focus global search).
    - Add in-app guided tour for new admins.
